# STATUS (overwrite each iteration; keep the first six lines in this exact key: value form)
- Prototype mode: scope is docs/PROTOTYPE.md, queue is docs/TASKS.md. Ghidra is skipped.
- Next: run P-03 Ledger, constant extraction, mediator tools.
- Environment: use the project-local Python 3.11 `.venv`. The Codex seatbelt rejects nested `sandbox-exec`; P-02 uses the task-authorized direct fallback only for that exact denial and records the limitation in proposed D-017.
